# RolodexV1
RolodexV1 is intended as a learning environment for me to practice general coding principes and 
get to grips with new GUI tools. The general plan it to create a GUI and fill it with uses for various context like fitness, calender, journal etc. For example the network context will be a digital rolodex of contact information for the users circle. Each card will have information specific to each contact and the user will be able to filter and sort these contacts as needed.

For example:
- How many lawyers do i know?
- Do i know anyone who works for company x?
- How many close friends have i known for y number od years?

Whether or not there is much value in the ability to view this info is irrelevant 
it's just an easy dataset to work with whilst im developing it.


For now i will start by adding a journaling application within RolodexV1 as I have wanted
to create one for myself for a while.

If you would like to view the programs GUI whilst im working on it, i ave set the username and password to both be equal to 'a' as there is no sensitive data stored in the program.
