# RolodexV1
RolodexV1 is intended as a learning environment for me to practice general coding principes and 
get to grips with new GUI tools. The general plan it to create a digital rolodex of contact information 
for the users circle. Each card will have information specific to each contact and the user will be able 
to filter and sort these contacts as needed.

For example:
- How many lawyers do i know?
- Do i know anyone who works for company x?
- How many close friends have i known for y number od years?

Whether or not there is much value in the ability to view this info is irrelevant 
it's just an easy dataset to work with whilst im developing it.
